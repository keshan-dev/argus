"""Tests for the team overview page (P5-004, Issue #36).

Verifies:
1. Unauthenticated request to /teams/{id} redirects to /login.
2. Unauthorized actor (different team) returns 403.
3. Successful team overview renders all 4 member states with distinct badges.
4. Attention items display blocker or risk tag, description, and link to profile.
5. Hero summary reflects attention count across the team.
6. Unmatched accounts banner displays when unmatched_count > 0.
7. Members are displayed alphabetically without ranking or comparison.
8. Empty team displays honest empty state note.
