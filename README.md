# ARGUS

An evidence-based engineering team intelligence agent. It tells a team lead what a team
member is working on, what is blocking them, and what is at risk, and it shows the
evidence behind every statement.

**Status:** Pre-development. Documentation foundation complete. No application code written yet.
**Stage:** MVP (Stage 1).
**Team:** 2 developers.

---

## 1. Problem

A team lead who wants to know "what is Keshan working on, and is anything blocking him"
has to check Jira, check GitHub, check who is waiting on a review, and then guess how
the pieces connect. This takes 20 to 40 minutes per day, it is repetitive, and the answer
is usually incomplete because the connection between a Jira ticket and the code that
implements it lives only in someone's head.

Existing dashboards show activity counts. Activity counts do not answer the question.

## 2. What ARGUS does

ARGUS ingests read-only data from Jira and GitHub, normalizes it into a single database,
explicitly links Jira issues to branches, pull requests and commits, and then answers a
small set of fixed questions about a team member using that linked evidence.

Every statement ARGUS makes is labelled as one of 3 classes:

| Class | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Fact | Directly backed by a source record | Jira shows AUTH-245 assigned to Keshan, status In Progress |
| Inference | Conclusion drawn from 2 or more evidence items | Keshan is likely working on AUTH-245, based on the assignment, branch activity and an open pull request |
| Unknown | Cannot be established from available sources | Exact real-time activity is unknown |

Every fact and inference cites the specific evidence items it came from, and each evidence
item links back to the Jira issue or GitHub page it was read from.

## 3. Who uses it

**Primary user:** the engineering team lead or delivery manager who runs a standup and
needs an accurate picture before it starts.

**Secondary user:** the team member themselves, to check how their own work appears and
to correct a wrong identity mapping.

ARGUS is not built for HR, and it is not built to compare people against each other.

## 4. Main capabilities (MVP)

- Read-only ingestion from GitHub and Jira into a canonical PostgreSQL model.
- An identity graph that maps a GitHub account and a Jira account to 1 internal person.
- Explicit, stored links between a Jira work item and its branches, pull requests and commits.
- A deterministic member summary: assigned work, status, open pull requests, recent activity.
- 3 fixed questions per member: current work, blockers, risks.
- 1 local LLM call per question, which writes the summary only. All findings are
  produced by deterministic rules (DEC-018).
- Deterministic validation, deterministic confidence (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / UNKNOWN).
- Conflict detection between Jira state and GitHub state.
- Scheduled sync every 5 minutes, plus an on-demand Refresh button (DEC-016).
- Visible data freshness, and honest reporting when a source is unavailable.
- A web UI: team overview, member profile, evidence drawer.

## 5. Out of scope for the MVP

These are deliberately excluded. Do not add them without a new decision record.

- Slack and Microsoft Teams.
- Calendar.
- Any write action. ARGUS never posts, comments, assigns, or changes a ticket.
- Numeric or percentage confidence scores.
- Vector search or semantic indexing.
- SSO, multi-tenancy, full RBAC. The MVP uses a login stub.
- Human-in-the-loop approval flows.
- Daily briefings and proactive notifications.
- Free-text natural language questions.
- Productivity scoring, ranking, or any comparison between team members. This is a
  permanent exclusion, not a deferral.

See `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` section 8 for the full MVP / Future / Out of Scope split.

## 6. High-level architecture

ARGUS has 2 separate data paths. This separation is the most important rule in the system.

```text
WRITE PATH (network, scheduled, Developer 1)
  GitHub API ---+
                +--> integration clients --> normalize --> PostgreSQL
  Jira API -----+                                            |
                                                             |
READ PATH (no network, per request, Developer 2)             |
                                                             v
  Browser --> FastAPI --> Agent Orchestrator --> read tools --+
                               |
                               +-- 1 LLM call (reasoning only)
                               +-- deterministic validation and confidence
```

**Agent-facing tools MUST NOT make external API calls.** They read PostgreSQL only.
Everything the agent sees was fetched earlier by the write path and recorded with a
timestamp. This makes answers fast, testable, reproducible, and immune to a source
being slow during a demo.

The agent runs 6 stages. Only 1 of them uses the LLM:

```text
S1 Plan -> S2 Retrieve -> S3 Build Evidence -> S4 Reason -> S5 Validate -> S6 Respond
  code       code            code               LLM          code          code
```

Full detail in `AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Ownership tags are enforced socially, not technically. See `TASKS.md` -> Developer Ownership.

## 9. Development setup

Requirements: Docker, Docker Compose, Python 3.11, a GitHub read-only token, a Jira API
token, and [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed on the host.

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2      # about 2 GB
ollama run llama3.2 "hi"   # pre-warm before demoing
```

**Memory note:** on a machine with 8 GB RAM or less, run Ollama on the host (not in
Docker) and close other applications before demoing. Measured difference: about 13
tokens/sec warm versus about 4 tokens/sec when RAM is starved.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd argus
cp .env.example .env
# fill in .env with your own read-only tokens, never commit it
docker compose up --build
docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head
docker compose exec api python seed/seed_demo.py
```

Open http://localhost:8000

`seed_demo.py` loads recorded API payloads from `seed/fixtures/` through the real
ingestion code. It makes no network calls, so the demo works offline and is identical
on both machines. See DEC-012.

## 10. How to run things

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Start everything | `docker compose up --build` |
| Apply migrations | `docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head` |

| Sync real GitHub data | `docker compose exec api python -m app.sync --source github --team 1` |
| Sync real Jira data | `docker compose exec api python -m app.sync --source jira --team 1` |
| Run tests | `docker compose exec api pytest` |
| Run evaluations | `docker compose exec api pytest tests/eval -v` |
| Lint | `ruff check . && black --check .` |

## 12. Development rules

These are not suggestions. They apply to every commit.

1. **Agent-facing tools MUST NOT make external API calls.** They read PostgreSQL only.
2. **The LLM MUST NOT be given any write tool.** Not now, not as a convenience.
3. **The LLM MUST NOT invent evidence.** It is never given claims or evidence IDs to
   produce. See DEC-018.
4. **Confidence MUST be assigned by application code**, never taken from model output.
5. **Retrieved external text is untrusted data**, never instructions. See `AI_BEHAVIOR.md` 5.6.
6. **Every network call MUST have a timeout and a retry limit**, and MUST log what was
   attempted, what came back, and what was skipped.
7. **Secrets come from environment variables only.** Never in code, prompts, logs, issues
   or commits. CI runs a secret scanner.
8. **Tools return Pydantic models**, never raw text blobs or raw upstream JSON.
9. **Typed failures.** Use `TIMEOUT`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `AUTH_FAILED`, `NOT_FOUND`,
   `UPSTREAM_ERROR`, `SCHEMA_INVALID`. A failure is never rendered as an empty result.
10. **Prompts are versioned files** in `app/agent/prompts/`, changed by PR like code.
11. **Small functions, small pull requests.** Target under 400 changed lines.
12. **Every task updates `WORKLOG.md` in the same pull request.**
13. **1 person creates an Alembic migration at a time.** Announce it first.
14. Plain direct language in the UI and docs. Numerals, no filler, no marketing tone.

## 13. Branching and review

- `main` is always working and demoable. Protected. Pull requests only.
- Branch naming: `type/<issue-number>-<short-desc>`, for example `feat/12-github-client`.
  Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`.
- Conventional Commits. Close issues with `Closes #n`.
- Squash merge. **Branches are kept after merge, not deleted.**
- CI must be green: lint, tests, secret scan, migration check.
- Developer 2's pull requests require Developer 1's approval. Developer 1 may merge
  their own work.

## 14. Current project status

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Documentation foundation | Complete |
| Repository created | Done. `keshan-dev/argus`, 49 issues, 12 labels, 4 milestones |
| `main` protected | Done. Pull request required, 1 approval, linear history |
| CI required to pass before merge | Done. 5 checks required: lint, tests, secret scan, migrations, project rules |
| Decisions ratified by both developers | Done, P0-006, all 19 accepted |
| Ollama verified | Keshan's machine only. Isiwara's numbers and the in-container check outstanding |
| Real Jira and GitHub test data | Not started, task P0-002. **The thing to protect** |
| Application code | None |
| Current sprint | Sprint 0, Phase 0 |

**Last reconciled:** 2026-09-19. If this table looks old, trust the repository and
`WORKLOG.md`, then fix the table. See `docs/HOW_TO.md` B10.

`TASKS.md` -> Current Sprint is the authoritative view of what is active.
`WORKLOG.md` is the authoritative view of what has actually happened.

## Before modifying the project, read

In this order. Do not skip the first 3.

1. **`README.md`** (this file) for orientation and the development rules.
2. **`DECISIONS.md`** for the constraints you are not allowed to quietly reverse.
3. **`TASKS.md`** for what is active, who owns it, and what it depends on.
4. **`PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`** for the requirement your task implements (FR IDs).
5. **`AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`** if your task touches the agent.
6. **`AI_BEHAVIOR.md`** if your task touches prompts, reasoning, validation or confidence.
7. **`AGENT_TOOLS.md`** if your task adds or changes a tool.
8. **`DATA_AND_EVIDENCE.md`** if your task touches the schema, ingestion or evidence.
9. **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** if your task crosses the write path / read path boundary.
10. **`TESTING_AND_EVALUATION.md`** before you open a pull request.
11. **`WORKLOG.md`** for what the other developer did most recently.

**For AI coding assistants:** read `DECISIONS.md` and `TASKS.md` before proposing any
change. Rules in section 12 above and in `AI_BEHAVIOR.md` are hard constraints. If a
task appears to require breaking one, stop and raise it as a Decision Required entry in
`WORKLOG.md` instead of working around it.
