# Headref UI pack

Everything needed to build the Headref UI canvas design in `keshan-dev/argus`.

## Quick start

1. Unzip at the repository root. Files land at their real paths (`app/web/...`,
   `docs/...`, `tests/web/...`). Nothing existing is overwritten except files with the
   same name, and none of these exist yet.
2. Read `docs/UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`. Section 2 lists the design decisions to record in
   `WORKLOG.md` first; section 10 is the build order; section 13 is a ready prompt for
   Claude Code or any coding agent.
3. Register the template filters where `Jinja2Templates` is created:

   ```python
   from app.web import ui_format
   ui_format.register(templates.env)
   ```

4. Mount static files at `/static`.
5. Run `pytest tests/web` to check escaping and the writing rules.

## What is here

No paid dependency, no CDN, no npm, no build step. The fonts are free (SIL Open Font
License) and bundled so the demo runs offline.
